# Lost and Found Logbook

**Class:** Main Application

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows / Linux Server, Web Frontend

An application consisting of a backend server and (potentially several) web frontends showing info about lost and found items

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```

## Run

To start up the Log and Found Logbook server after it has been built, you can call under Windows:

```
run.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
run.sh
```

Once the server is started, you can connect to it from a local webbrowser - or if you make the server machine available to the outside world, then also from there. :)
